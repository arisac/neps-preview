      <description>Simple Summary #  A standard interface for tokens.
Abstract #  The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.
Motivation #  A standard interface allows any tokens on NewChain to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.</description>

      <description>Summary: #  In order to ensure the scarcity and reasonable liquidity of Newton tokens (NEW), based on the ideas and opinions of all parties, the following suggestions are put forth to modify the token release rules.
Details: #  The plan for Newton Foundation reserved token release as stated in the Newton White Paper V0.5 is that “1/2 of the total is immediately unlocked, while the rest will be unlocked 1/12 every month.</description>

      <description>Simple Summary #  A standard interface for invoice token.
Abstract #  The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for invoice token within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to issue、reimburse and invalidate invoice token.
Motivation #  A standard interface allows tax/invoice/financial applications to work with invoice token on NewChain. We provide for simple invoiceToken smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of invoice tokens.</description>

      <title>NEAT Backed Currency (NBC)</title>
      <link>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0023.html</link>

      <guid>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0023.html</guid>
      <description>Simple Summary #   NEAT Backed Currency (NBC) is a kind of cryptographically secured currency following the design protocol of NEAT. The goal of this creation is the allow anyone to create a set of exchangeable, and divisible asset that can be securely exchanged using the platform provided by Newton Community. We used the term community, because the distributed security, must be backed by a community of infrastructure providers and a rather healthy exchange community.</description>

      <guid>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0000.html</guid>
      <description>Summary: #  For the sake of the open, transparent governance, we propose compiling all suggestions related to the Newton Project using the Newton Evolution Proposal (NEP) template for unified numbering and management. The proposals are then put to the community for broader discussion, getting opinions and suggestions from all parties involved before forming final conclusions.
Details: #   Anyone can submit an NEP. The Newton Foundation is responsible for assigning an exclusive number to each.</description>

      <description>Simple Summary #  NewOrg template standard represents the living organization in newton ecosystem and a new DAO paradigm for the next generation social governance and collaboration.
Abstract #  NewOrg methods and standard based on NewChain and smart contract technologies are defined as is:
 based on NewChain and its smart contract technologies. to replace the traditional limited corporation with new governance paradigm based on blockchain technologies. to define a set of meta rules for organization governance, and clarify the separation of these rules between NewChain layer and contract layer to implement: (1) business irrelative meta rules; (2) flexibility of neworg governance token; (3) anchoring all neworg to NewChain.</description>

      <title>Newton Composite Asset (NCA)</title>
      <link>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0022.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0022.html</guid>
      <description>Simple Summary #  Newton Composite Asset (NCA) is the base pattern of asset combination that defines the boundary of how two or more than two assets are combined as a single instance. NCA distinguishes from the other types of asset by involving more than one NEAT. Every NCA is defined based on the principle of Behavioral Equivalence1, so that unique properties of NCA can be distinguished computationally and therefore maximize the possibility of code reuse and automated asset valuation.</description>

      <title>Newton Encoded Asset Transaction (NEAT)</title>
      <link>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0020.html</link>

      <guid>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0020.html</guid>
      <description>Simple Summary #  Newton Encoded Asset Transaction(NEAT) defines the root data type for all asset exchanges. Once a new record of NEAT is registered into Newchain, it represents a form of irrefutable accountability based on the immutable features of Newchain. To help transaction assess the worthiness of transactions before their commitment, all transactions have a common field, called: Bounded Accountability, which defines all known exit conditions when a transactional process is breached.</description>

      <guid>http://arisac.github.io/neps-preview/neps/nep-0024.html</guid>
      <description>Simple Summary #  Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC) is a cryptographically insured asset that works with exchangeable assets within the Newton Community. It can be extended to issue Membership Card, Score Cards, or even Balanced Score Cards. It can also possess negotiating powers in attaining tangible goods. For example, one may pre-pay for editable goods, such as vegetable, milk, or beef, or other kinds of commercially viable goods. The basic assumptions about NPC is that it provides a classification scheme to define goods.</description>

      <description>Simple Summary #  A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.
Abstract #  The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.
We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets.</description>

      <description>Simple Summary #  A standard interface for Physical Commodity token
Abstract #  This template mainly uses the block chain encryption and non tampering features to verify the ownership, capital flow, receipt confirmation and other information of the physical Commodity involved in the production and circulation process, and synthesizes the information flow, capital flow and logistics flowing in the whole process of raw material suppliers, producers, channel agents, dealers and consumers through the block chain technology There is a sound system of credit value flow.</description>
